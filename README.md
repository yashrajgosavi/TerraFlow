# 🌍 TerraFlow – Multi-Cloud Terraform Deployment 🚀  

**TerraFlow** is a structured Terraform project designed to simplify and standardize the deployment of resources across **AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes**. This repository serves as a step-by-step learning journey for mastering Terraform while building a streamlined and scalable infrastructure deployment process.  

## 💡 Why TerraFlow?  
Terraform simplifies infrastructure management, but deploying to multiple platforms efficiently requires a structured approach. **TerraFlow** bridges this gap by providing a **multi-cloud deployment flow**, making it easier to work with AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Well-organized Terraform folder structure  
✅ Modular and reusable Terraform configurations  
✅ Deployment workflows for AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes  
✅ Best practices for state management and security  
✅ CI/CD automation with Terraform and GitHub Actions  
✅ Comprehensive documentation and learning resources 

## 🎯 Goals  
- Learn and implement Terraform from scratch  
- Develop a structured, scalable, and reusable Terraform setup  
- Automate cloud infrastructure provisioning efficiently  
- Provide clear, beginner-friendly documentation for easy adoption  


## 📖 Getting Started with Terraform  
### Basic Terraform Commands  
Here are the fundamental Terraform commands I have learned so far:  

**Initialize Terraform**  
```bash
terraform init
```  
This command initializes the Terraform working directory, downloads required provider plugins, and sets up the backend configuration.  

**Plan Infrastructure Changes**  
```bash
terraform plan
```  
Generates an execution plan, showing what changes Terraform will make before applying them.  

**Apply Changes**  
```bash
terraform apply
```  
Executes the planned changes and provisions the resources.  

**Destroy Infrastructure**  
```bash
terraform destroy
```  
Removes all resources defined in the Terraform configuration.  

**Destroy a Specific Resource**  
```bash
terraform destroy -target resource_type.resource_name
```  
Deletes a specific resource without affecting the rest of the infrastructure.  

**List All Resources in the State File**  
```bash
terraform state list
```  
Displays all resources that are currently managed by Terraform in the state file. This helps in checking what infrastructure has been deployed and is being tracked.  

**Show Details of a Specific Resource**  
```bash
terraform state show resource_type.resource_name
```  
Shows detailed information about a specific resource in the Terraform state. This is useful for debugging and verifying resource properties such as IDs, configurations, and dependencies.  

**Define and Output a Resource Value**  
```hcl
output "output-name" {
  value = resource_type.resource_name.id
}
```  
Terraform **outputs** allow users to extract and display resource attributes after deployment. This is commonly used to retrieve values like public IPs, resource IDs, or database endpoints.
